# **Introduction**

This is the documentation for **Next Foundation**. It is a **starting template** for new projects, and a **reference** for existing projects.

-   **Scalable.** This project is built with scalability in mind. It provides a guide for seperation of concerns using a modular approach. 
-   **Strict code style.** This project uses [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) to enforce a strict code style. This makes it easy to work with other developers.
-   **Based on Next.js 15.** This project is built on top of Next.js 15. This means that all the great features of Next.js 15 are available. It will be upgraded to the latest versions of Next.
-   **Frontend-first.** This project is built with a frontend-first mindset. A lot of teams want to seperate frontend and API's. For example by using [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), even though Next.js can be used as a [fullstack framework](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4UhNo3HAMw).

## **Why Next.js?**

We use **Next.js** because it has a very large userbase and has the best DX of all React frameworks. 
 Read extensive documentation about **Next.js** [here](https://nextjs.org/docs).

## **Installation**

Make sure NPM & Node are working, preferably use Corepack.

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

### Commands:

```bash
pnpm run dev # Run Next.js development server
