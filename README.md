# **Next.js Foundation**

A very **solid architecture** for scalable Next.js projects.

### **Quick setup**

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

## **Rationale**

Next.js it is a great framework for building React applications. It is very easy to get started with and has a lot of great features. However, it's not very opinionated about how a project should be structured. This is fine for a small project built in free time but can become a problem when working on a large project with a team of developers. This is where this project comes in.

<sub>⚠️Note: Of course, this is just one way to structure a project. Feel free to use this as a starting point and adapt it to specific needs.</sub>
